# Educational Disclaimer

**⚠️ IMPORTANT: FOR EDUCATIONAL AND RESEARCH PURPOSES ONLY**

This application is developed as a coursework project for UBC PSYC_V 301 901 2025W1 Brain Dysfunction and Recovery with Dr.Steven Barnes, and is intended solely for educational demonstration and learning purposes.

## Scientific Basis

• Based on GWAS from Zhang et al. (2020), demonstrating late-onset Alzheimer's disease exhibits oligogenic architecture.

• Uses 22 SNPs from PGS000334 (PGS Catalog, 2020), representing the same genetic associations from Zhang et al. (2020)

• Follows established PRS principles outlined in Choi et al. (2020)

• Original GWAS data from 388,324 individuals: 80.9% European ancestry, 19.1% ancestry not reported

## Medical Disclaimer

• NOT medical advice, diagnosis, or treatment recommendations

• NOT predictive of actual Alzheimer's disease risk or health outcomes

• NOT approved by FDA or other regulatory bodies

• Consult qualified healthcare providers for any health concerns

• Real genetic testing requires laboratory analysis and clinical interpretation

## Technical Limitations

• Uses simulated genotypes for educational demonstration only

• Population percentiles are simulated and do NOT represent actual population distributions

• Risk interpretations are simplified educational models, not clinical assessments

• May not generalize to non-European ancestry groups due to population-specific genetic architecture

• Does not account for age, family history, environmental factors, or clinical variables

• Missing quality control steps required for real PRS analysis (population stratification, relatedness checks, etc.)

• No validation in independent datasets

## Data Privacy and Security

• Browser-based application with no data encryption

• No secure data transmission or storage protocols

• Genetic information entered is not protected

• Not suitable for real genetic data input

• No privacy safeguards implemented

## Software Limitations

• Software provided "AS IS" without warranty of any kind

• May contain bugs, errors, or computational inaccuracies

• No guarantee of software reliability or accuracy

• Subject to change without notice

• No technical support provided
